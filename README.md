Cleansearch is 'the' way to find a file on Windows Vista, XP, Windows 7/8/8.1/10. Because the built-in search engine is crap, I built my own, and it works like a charm.
You can search for 'MyFile' or for multiple things using 'MyFile|MyOtherFile'. The parser recognizes '&' as the AND operator, '|' as the OR operator and '<' and '>' as grouping parentheses (so a query as '<A | B> & <C | D>' is valid).
Special commands (such as 'music?') search for different file types (but only the most common extensions). Included are
music?
sounds?
videos?
images?
documents?

On an average SSD with 500.000 files, it searches it all within 10 seconds + it is portable on USB-stick.

For the rest, just enjoy!
